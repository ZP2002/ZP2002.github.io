<p>I was trying to go for a chaotic dubstep sound and I think I achieved that. It's random and chaotic but has a catchy beat behind it all. I really enjoy electronic music but they sometimes sound the same because they never try to go out of the box with the beat. I added two new tracks that involved an electronic piano. I think it would go well in a movie at a club scene on a foreign planet. One artist that inspired me to make this was Camellia </p>

<p>Hello, my name is Zachary Peck. I am a student at GCU and I enjoy living on campus. I enjoy rock climbing and playing video games as well as doing homework every weekend.
I was born in Kentucky and moved to Montana when I was 10 it is very cold there compared to Arizona. Miss skiing in Montana and the snow. However, I enjoy the weather during the winter here in Arizona. My major is in cyber and I love working with technology.</p>
